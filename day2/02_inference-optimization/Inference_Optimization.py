# # Inference Optimization Lab — **The Margin Call**
#
# Your firm signed **Project HELVETICA**: an AI-assisted contract-diligence engagement for
# **Aldgate Capital Partners**, who are acquiring Volta Industrial Group — a roll-up of 14
# companies with a supplier-contract estate of **248,000 documents**. The deal team needs every
# contract triaged for change-of-control consent, liability caps, auto-renewal, and governing law.
#
# The demo team built an agent — **ClauseScan v0** — the night before the pitch. It works.
# It is also slow enough that analysts alt-tab away while it thinks, and its unit economics
# quietly eat the engagement margin. The pitch landed, the SOW is signed, and as of this
# morning **you own it**.
#
# What the client signed:
#
# | SLA term | Commitment |
# |---|---|
# | Accuracy | ≥ 90% on audited fields |
# | Interactive latency | p50 ≤ 5s per contract in analyst working sessions |
# | Unit economics | COGS ≤ $0.02 per contract at production scale |
# | Fee | $0.75 per reviewed contract (fixed) |
#
# **The lab in three acts:**
# 1. **Parts 1–2 — Instrument & baseline.** Build the measurement toolkit, run the initial tests
#    across Haiku / Sonnet / Opus.
# 2. **Parts 3–4 — Diagnose & learn the levers.** Run ClauseScan v0, see the damage, then work
#    through six optimization levers one at a time, measuring each.
# 3. **Parts 5–6 — The optimization sprint.** Rebuild the pipeline, climb the leaderboard, and
#    auto-generate the before/after slide you'd take to the steering committee.
#
# **Key metrics:**
# - **TTFT** — Time To First Token: how long the analyst stares at a spinner.
# - **TTC** — Time To Completion: total request duration.
# - **OTPS** — Output Tokens Per Second: generation throughput after streaming starts.
# - **$/contract** — fully loaded cost per document, including cache reads and writes.
#
# > 💸 Running every cell in this notebook costs roughly **$2–4** of API usage, most of it in the
# > deliberately wasteful v0 baseline. That's part of the lesson.
#
# ---
#
# **Prepared for Partner Basecamp participants.** Not for reproduction or redistribution as training material — you're free to apply these patterns in your own client work.

PLAYBOOK_CORE = """You are ClauseScan, the contract-diligence reviewer for Project HELVETICA \
(Aldgate Capital Partners' acquisition of Volta Industrial Group). You review supplier \
contracts and report five audited fields. Work only from the contract text provided. Never \
guess: if the contract is silent on a point, report it as absent rather than inventing terms.

## Audited fields
1. auto_renewal (boolean) — true only if the contract renews automatically absent notice. A \
fixed term that expires, or renewal "by mutual written agreement", is NOT auto-renewal.
2. change_of_control (boolean) — true if assignment or change of control of either party \
requires the counterparty's prior consent, or gives the counterparty a termination right. \
Free assignment or notice-only assignment is false.
3. liability_cap_usd (number or null) — the aggregate liability cap in USD. null if no cap is \
stated, if liability is expressly uncapped, or if an amendment removed the cap. Amendments \
override the original clause — always check for amendments before reporting.
4. governing_law (string) — the governing jurisdiction, e.g. "Delaware" or "England and Wales".
5. risk_tier (LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH) — apply this rule exactly:
   HIGH = change-of-control consent/termination right present AND no liability cap.
   MEDIUM = exactly one of those two red flags present.
   LOW = neither red flag (no change-of-control restriction AND a cap is stated).

## Review discipline
- Read every section, then re-check the two red-flag clauses before concluding.
- Quote-check: the evidence you cite must appear in the contract.
- Deal context: Aldgate's purchase will itself trigger change-of-control clauses across the \
estate — that is why the field is audited.

# **The diagnosis.** v0 is *correct* — and that's exactly what makes it dangerous: nothing
# looks broken in the demo, so it ships, and the waste compounds 248,000 times. Name the sins:
#
# 1. **Opus for everything.** Most of a contract estate is boilerplate a cheaper model reads
#    perfectly well.
# 2. **The 5K-token playbook is re-billed at full price on every call** — twice per contract.
#    It never changes. It's the textbook prompt-caching candidate.
# 3. **Two serial round trips** where one would do. The "briefing" pass doubles latency and
#    bills its own output as the next call's input.
# 4. **Verbose free-text output** — "explain step by step in detail, then JSON." Output tokens
#    are **5× the price** of input tokens, and every extra token also costs wall-clock time.
# 5. **No streaming.** The analyst stares at a dead screen for the full TTC.
# 6. **Sequential batch.** Six contracts take six contracts' worth of wall-clock; 248,000 take
#    a quarter-million.
#
# Five of these are levers you pull to make the surviving calls cheaper or faster. The sixth,
# the round trip, isn't — it's a call you delete before you optimize the rest. Part 4 takes
# them one at a time, with the meter running.

# %% [markdown]
# # Part 4 · The six levers
#
# **First, eliminate the round trip you never needed.** Before you make any call cheaper, delete
# the one you didn't need. Every serial round trip pays full freight: network + prefill +
# generation, and chained calls re-bill earlier output as new input. v0's "briefing" pass is
# pure round-trip tax — the same tax you'll meet again with tool calls (request → `tool_use` →
# execute → result → response) and multi-step chains. Collapse steps that don't earn their
# latency. v0's two passes become one, and every lever below operates on that single surviving
# call.
#
# ## Lever 1 — Prompt caching: stop re-buying the playbook
#
# One call per contract now. Make it stop re-buying the playbook.
#
# Caching is a **prefix match**: tools → system → messages, and any byte change invalidates
# everything after it. Our playbook is a frozen prefix by design. Mark it with `cache_control`
# and the API stores the processed prefix: the first call pays a **1.25×** write premium;
# every call inside the TTL (5 min) reads it back at **0.1×** — and skips reprocessing it,
# which also cuts TTFT.
#
# Field notes for client work: minimum cacheable prefix is **4096 tokens on Opus/Haiku, 2048
# on Sonnet** (shorter prefixes silently don't cache); keep volatile content — timestamps,
# request IDs, the contract itself — *after* the cached block; and verify with
# `usage.cache_read_input_tokens`, not vibes.

# On a 248K-contract estate, maybe 15–25% genuinely need senior attention — amendments that

# **triage pass on Haiku** (cheap, fast, tiny output) and route: ROUTINE → Haiku or Sonnet,
# COMPLEX → Sonnet or Opus. This is staffing leverage, the thing your firm already understands:
# you don't put the senior partner on every NDA.

# ## Lever 3 — Output discipline: schemas, not essays
#
# Output tokens cost **5× input tokens** and each one costs generation time (TTC ≈ TTFT +
# output_tokens ÷ OTPS). v0 asks for step-by-step prose *plus* JSON. The fix is **structured
# outputs**: `output_config.format` with a JSON schema. The response *is* the deliverable —
# valid JSON, no parsing regex, no preamble — and the risk rubric lives in the field
# descriptions, so the schema doubles as the spec your QA partner signs off on.
#
# Two dials that live in the same neighborhood:
# - `max_tokens` — a hard ceiling; right-size it to the artifact (our JSON needs ~300, not 8000).
# - `output_config.effort` — Sonnet/Opus accept `low`–`max` to trade depth for tokens.
#   **It errors on Haiku 4.5** — Haiku is already the low-latency tier.

# Not every contract needs an analyst watching. Split the workload like an engagement team

# - **Backfill lane** — the other ~235K documents run overnight through the **Batch API** at
#   **50% off all token charges** (most batches finish within an hour; results persist 29 days).
#
# Same models, same prompts, same schema — half the price, in exchange for latency you weren't
# going to spend anyway. This split — *what the client touches* vs *what runs in the dark* —
# is the single highest-leverage architecture question on volume engagements.

# # Part 5 · The optimization sprint 🏁
#
# Now it's yours. `clausescan_v1` below starts as a faithful copy of v0 — it will score
# **≈ 100** (that's the baseline index). Pull levers by editing `CONFIG`, then re-run the
# scorecard. When `CONFIG` stops being enough, edit the function itself — that's encouraged.
#
# **Scoring** (the SLA, condensed into one number):
#
# ```
# accuracy < 90%  →  SCORE = 0 (gate — no partial credit for fast, wrong answers)
# otherwise       →  SCORE = 50 × (baseline_$ / your_$) + 50 × (baseline_p50 / your_p50)
# ```
#
# v0 = 100. Cut cost 4× and latency 2× → 300. A strong configuration clears 400.
#
# **Rules of engagement:**
# 1. Accuracy ≥ 90% on the sample — and your pipeline must *read the contracts*. Hardcoding
#    answers scores zero with the holdout set (and your code gets read out loud).
# 2. Any model, any caching, any routing, any concurrency. Creativity within the API is the point.
# 3. Post your leaderboard line in the session chat after each run. Beat the table.

# # Wrap-up — the levers, as a client checklist
#
# Walk into any inference-cost conversation with this list and you will earn your rate:
#
# 1. **Measure first** — TTFT, TTC, OTPS, cache-aware $/unit. No baseline, no benefits case.
# 2. **Model portfolio + routing** — cheap models for volume, expensive models for judgment, a
#    triage pass deciding which is which.
# 3. **Cache the frozen prefix** — playbooks, tool definitions, system prompts. Verify with
#    `cache_read_input_tokens`, mind the per-model minimums, keep volatile bytes out of the prefix.
# 4. **Discipline the output** — structured outputs as the deliverable spec, right-sized
#    `max_tokens`, `effort` dialed to the task (never on Haiku).
# 5. **Collapse round trips, stream the rest** — every serial call is latency and re-billed
#    context; TTFT is the UX number.
# 6. **Parallelize with care** — warm the cache, then fan out inside your rate limits.
# 7. **Two-speed architecture** — interactive lane for humans, Batch API (50% off) for the dark
#    backlog. Decide per workload, not per project.
# 8. **Gate everything on accuracy** — a quality eval runs *before* the optimization victory lap.
#    (Yesterday's evals session is the other half of this lab.)
